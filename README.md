# hello-world
First repository on GitHub

This is the first commit to the readme file, which itself is in the feature branch called 'readme-edits' right now, which is the version of the master branch in which we are making changes. Following the change, it will be committed, or saved. So now the feature branch called 'readme-edits' will contain content that's different from the master branch. The feature branch may be merged with the master branch later.
